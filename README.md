# AI-Powered Smart Contract Templates

Welcome to a collection of **smart contract starter templates generated with AI**.  
Each contract includes the **prompt used to generate it** right in the code comments, so you can see how it was made and get ideas for your own projects.  

## Features
- Ready-to-use Solidity contracts for **tokens, staking, governance, NFTs, DeFi, and more**.  
- Prompts included in every contract for **easy AI re-generation or modification**.  
- Designed as a **starter kit** for learning, prototyping, or building your own smart contract projects.  

## How to Use
1. Browse the `contracts/` folder to find a contract template.  
2. Check the comment at the top of each file for the AI prompt used.  
3. Deploy or customize the contract using your favorite Ethereum development framework (Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, etc.).  
4. Modify the prompt and regenerate contracts with AI for new ideas.  

## Notes
- All contracts are **for educational and prototyping purposes**.  
- Always review, test, and audit code **before deploying on mainnet**.
